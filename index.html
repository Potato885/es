    <p id="para">My favrouite hobbies are Reading! I love reading because it is calming and I really enjoy it! I have lots of free time and when I am bored I like to read! It's an entire new world the author has created! and you get to explore it. If you think reading is boring, (thats what I thought at first) with this mindset it makes reading much more fun. I was in the hospital for a week when I was young, and I had nothing to do so i decided to read there was only 1 problem one I started reading I could not stop! It was a great time pass it felt like the week flew by in a matter of seconds</p>
